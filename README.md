# The-Gaming-Room
Design doc for CS 230

The-Gaming-Room requested consultation when creating a web-based version of their new game Draw It or Lose It. These design docs cover the direction I recommend The-Gaming-Room should take to successfully implement a program that is secure and meets requirements. 
This document provides a framework with which The Gaming Room can implement a secure, and lightweight web-based version of Draw It or Lose It. By showing examples of memory and storage best practices, as well as recommendations for the best tools for their particular use case. 
More work needs to be done regarding recommendations for operating systems themselves.
The client lays out the hard requirements as to how the software needs to be designed and deployed. This is especially important when considering the user experience over a wide range of operating platforms. Different operating systems can have wildly different requirements.
These requirements necessitate the use of secure, modular design approaches. By creating robust, modular code now allows for the process to be repeatable for other applications and use cases.
